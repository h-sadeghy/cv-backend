    description:
      "The latest data confidently demonstrates that utilizing hypnosis as a pain relief strategy is incredibly successful. Our most conservative estimates reveal that after completing treatment and even in the longest-term follow-up, the average individual utilizing hypnosis experiences a pain reduction more significantly than ۷۵% of those who did not utilize hypnosis. This suggests that hypnosis is just as effective as other pain reduction methods such as biofeedback, CBT, mindfulness, and distraction. Through our study, we found that hypnotic suggestibility plays a crucial role in determining how effective hypnosis is as a pain management technique. Individuals with high levels of suggestibility may benefit more from hypnosis than from other commonly used psychological methods. Our findings also reveal that hypnosis offers similar relief in terms of both physical and emotional pain, making it a valuable therapeutic option for people with chronic pain.",

    description:
      "In civil engineering and construction, there's a growing focus on using technology to locate and track resources like workers, equipment, and materials. This helps improve productivity, monitor progress, and enhance workplace safety. While GPS is widely used for outdoor tracking, its usefulness indoors is limited due to poor signal reception, particularly in tunnels and buildings. Indoor localization has been extensively studied, but these advancements often rely on robust external communication networks, which can be disrupted by electromagnetic interference in noisy construction environments. This study proposes an indoor localization system using a microcontroller and an IMU (inertial measurement unit). The IMU combines a magnetometer, gyroscope, and accelerometer. Using direct cosine matrix fusion, the microcontroller calculates non-gravitational acceleration from sensor data. Location is determined through integration, accounting for uncertainty in speed estimation. The acceleration and heading obtained from the IMU are used to determine the current location. The system is self-sufficient and operates regardless of external factors. Experimental findings illustrate its accuracy and effectiveness.",

    description:
      "One of the most widely acknowledged facts in palliative care is the prevalence of psychological illnesses. However, these conditions often remain unnoticed and unaddressed, adding to the already profound suffering of those dealing with serious medical and psychological struggles. Specifically, this piece will delve into the topic of depression, as it is one of the most common mental illnesses faced by palliative care psychiatrists and psychotherapists. Despite various psychotherapies and antidepressant medications being available, many individuals with depression in palliative care do not respond to treatment, highlighting the need for more effective interventions. Since depression is a complex illness, it stands to reason that the presence of other medical conditions would only exacerbate its manifestation in palliative care. As such, it is of utmost importance that healthcare professionals continually develop more effective depression therapies within this setting. This article discusses the evidence-based multimodal treatment of cognitive hypnosis, which has demonstrated promise in treating depression among various palliative care patients. However, it should be noted that this treatment is an ongoing effort that will be further tested and refined with advancements in clinical depression research, and cannot be considered a finalized solution at this stage.Keywords",

    type: "conference",
    tags: ["معماری و عمران"],
    description:
      "In construction projects, measuring labor input is crucial for on-site control and management since it's the primary predictor of project outcomes. However, traditional manual methods for measuring labor input are time-consuming, not done in real-time, and lack effectiveness. This study presents a novel solution to address this challenge. It utilizes Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors attached to hand tools during construction activities to measure labor input accurately and in real time. The approach consists of phases, identifying local specific structures, computing self-similarity matrices, and extracting temporal-spatial features. This approach provides a more precise and timely measurement of labor input, improving project control and management. This research also suggests that patterns of repetition in hand tool usage data can be automatically identified and then used to measure the amount of labor input. A working prototype and research study was developed, focusing on counting rotations for a screw-connection activity to test the idea. The goal is to assess the usability of this method in broader construction contexts. Experiments illustrate that IMU sensors on hand tools can measure labor input effectively and efficiently. The accuracy of the results was confirmed by comparing them to real-world data. We are currently working on improving the accuracy of activity segmentation and speeding up feature extraction. These improvements will reduce measurement errors and help us better understand construction behaviors on-site",
